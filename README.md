## User Story

As a traveler,
I want to check flight status if it was delayed or arriving on time.
,check the weather at the point of departure and the destination
, and the time difference if there is any
(maybe like the % of the way the flight is complete)

Goal

By searching flight number,

    - Flight informations
    AeroDataBox
        - airline name
        - departure city, date, time
        - arrival city, date, time
        - Maybe ( map of the journey )

    - Flight status
    AeroDataBox
        - early
        - delayed
        - ontime

    - Weather info
    openweathermap
        - destination
        - future days weather info
            - if it's sunny day in the future - recommend to the users
            - rain or bad weather expected on the arrival date- warning?
                - bad weather expected - recommend close city which has nice weather with sunshine.

    - time difference
    AeroDataBox

Benefit

All users travel can have gret informations!
